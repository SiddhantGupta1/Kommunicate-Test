The best project I have worked on would be an e-commerce website whose front-end, I have made it from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. In the project, I have used material UI for some components, given basic functionalities which any e-commerce website has, and created multiple pages such as Cart, Profile, Categories, Product, Payment, and a Home Page.

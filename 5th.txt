If I were going to start a software company, I would choose Arnav Sharma - he is an organizer in Aaruush(One of the biggest tech fests in South India), because of his skills in sales and marketing as a new company would be needing a lot of marketing to grow. The second person I would choose would be Shivam Dawar, he is a skilled person in the field of AI/ML and is quite good at problem-solving. As for me, I am a Full-stack developer and I would be handling the development process and also the business side of the company as I have a business background.
